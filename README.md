# Standard Notes themes

Repository for community contributed themes for [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/).

## Notes

- Url should be entered in the desktop app as the url of the css theme file
  followed by `?type=theme&name=TheThemeName`.
- Desktop app wants the url to end with `.css` otherwise it won't apply the
  theme (possible bug or security feature?)
- Mobile app adds `.json` to the url. Planned is for it to strip the `.css`
  first, but currently does not.
- Pull requests, comments, issues, suggestions all welcome!

## Themes

### Solarized (Dark)

Dark solarized theme, based on the official [Midnight theme](https://standardnotes.org/extensions/midnight).
Uses mainly official solarized colours, tweaked slightly for greater contrast
and visibility on mobile.  Features proper solarized code syntax highlighting
in editors.
